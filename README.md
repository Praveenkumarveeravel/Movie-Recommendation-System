Project Overview
This project is a Movie Recommendation System that suggests movies to users based on their preferences. It utilizes Collaborative Filtering (K-NN) and Content-Based Filtering techniques to make personalized movie recommendations. The system analyzes user behavior (such as ratings) and movie metadata to provide accurate and relevant recommendations.

Technologies Used
Python: Programming language for developing the model.
Pandas: For data manipulation and analysis.
NumPy: For numerical computations.
Scikit-learn: For building the K-NN model and other machine learning tasks.
Cosine Similarity: For calculating similarity in content-based filtering.
Jupyter Notebook: For interactive development and testing.
Installation
Clone the repository to your local machine:
bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/movie-recommendation-system.git
Navigate to the project directory:
bash
Copy code
cd movie-recommendation-system
Install the required dependencies:
bash
Copy code
pip install -r requirements.txt
Dataset
The system uses the MovieLens dataset which contains:

Movie metadata (genres, directors, etc.)
User ratings for movies
Approach
Collaborative Filtering (K-NN):

Based on user ratings. If two users have similar tastes (rated similar movies highly), movies liked by one user can be recommended to the other.
Uses K-Nearest Neighbors (K-NN) to find similar users or items.
Content-Based Filtering:

Recommends movies that are similar to the ones the user liked, based on movie metadata such as genre, director, and cast.
Cosine Similarity is used to compute the similarity between movies.
How to Run
Ensure the necessary libraries are installed using the command:
bash
Copy code
pip install -r requirements.txt
Open the Jupyter Notebook:
bash
Copy code
jupyter notebook
Run the notebook step-by-step to generate recommendations based on the dataset.
Features
User-based Collaborative Filtering: Recommends movies based on users with similar preferences.
Item-based Collaborative Filtering: Recommends movies that are similar to what a user has liked in the past.
Content-Based Filtering: Recommends movies based on their content, such as genre and actors.
Future Enhancements
Incorporate Matrix Factorization techniques like SVD for better collaborative filtering performance.
Implement a hybrid system that combines collaborative and content-based filtering for improved recommendations.
Build a web interface using Flask/Django to make the system user-friendly.
